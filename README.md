a minimal command line intepreter.

it still requires a lot (emphasis on the "a lot") of work.  I plan on adding more commands and more options to existing commands but at this point it is just a skeleton of a cli with minimal functionality.  

But it works, in case you were wondering.


If you want to use it just download it and run "make" to compile.  To run the executable type "./cli" and then "help" when inside the interpreter to get a list of the commands.
